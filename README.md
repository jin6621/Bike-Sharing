## Overview of the analysis: 
##### Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of this analysis is to provide potential insight on the bike usage in NYC. Based on the 7 data visualizations provided, we are able to identify riders trends. 

## Results: 
##### Using the visualization you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image. 

[Please refer to the visualization]

## Summary: 
##### Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset. 

With the support of data visualization, we get a better understanding of the overall bike usage in NYC. 

We can summarize by stating that males are the majority of the riders. People at age 32-ish (Born in 1989) rent bikes the most. Most of the riders checkout bikes for 5 minutes. The busiest day of the week is Thursday. The busiest hours is after-work hours, 5pm and 6pm. 

With the given dataset, I would perform:

- data visualization with geographic location to show which store has the highest start/end location (We can consider providing more bike rental in the nearby area to reduce conjestion.)
- data visualization to showcase which area of NYC consists of most elder riders. (We can consider providing safety protocol to ensure elders riding safely)
